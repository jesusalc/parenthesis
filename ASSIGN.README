You have an array of strings, like that

[
 '() [] () ([]()[])',
 '( (] ([)]',
 '{}[]()',
 '{{}]}',
 '{[}',
 '[}]'
];

implement please the function which 
prints 'YES' into output if
the string has proper 
amount of parenthesis.

By proper amount of parenthesis 
we understand the case 
when for the each
opening parentheses 
we have appropriated closing one.

Result for the array above, looks like this:

[
  'YES',
  'NO',
  'YES'
  'NO'
  'NO',
  'NO'
]
